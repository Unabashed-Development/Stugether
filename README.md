Welcome to the repositoy of Stugether, your student matching application!

## Origin
Stugether was developed as part of a 6-week challenge by University of Applied Sciences Windesheim. The challenge consisted of developing a desktop application from scratch, simulating a real world project. To develop the application, we created extensive functional + technical designs and a test plan. Our team, Unabashed Development (UNA-D) followed the Agile SCRUM project management method. For further inquries, feel free to shoot us a message!

## Reason
More and more often the news is that many students are not feeling well. That has several causes. A major player is the current corona pandemic, which separates students from each other. Loneliness is the most common complaint at 80%. UNA-D thinks this is alarmingly high and has taken the initiative to develop an application that connects students.

## Goal
Basically, Stugether is a matching application, in which students from different universities can get in touch with each other. The algorithm that the application has ensures that students with similar interests, norms and values, age, univerities and locations are linked with each other. Of course, the application will not be exclusive to students with mental health problems. With this way of matching, we hope to match students with different intentions, such as a study buddy or a relationship, in the best possible way.

## Dependencies
The application is closely involved with a database, web server and mail server. As such, it is not possible to run the application stand-alone. In the newest releases, a copy of the database is downloadable, might you want to build the application for yourself.
